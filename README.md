# HTML-study

Examples of the most common HTML elements.

Not a very pretty example, but I limited myself to HTML only. Also using this as a chance to play with GitHub more.

## Elements included:

    <nav>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <hr>
    <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5>
    <p>
    <img>
    <a>
    <button>
    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>
    <form>
    <label>
    <input>
    <footer>
